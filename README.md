# 20questions
C# Application for 20 questions using Windows Forms. This program stores data into a file named Bintree.txt and labels each topic the user inserts. Stores and loads each property inserted by the user and recursively uses traversals to guess the user's person. Created a more cartoon-styled GUI theme to fit the age range of the people that would be playing.
